Biopython is colletion of modules and sub modules.
It is set of freely  avaliable tools which will be used for biological computations.
we can deal with dna and rna sequences.

to install the biopython:-
pip3 install biopython


functions:-
---------------

function is a block of code which takes input to do some specific operations and produces the output

if we create the functions we will not required to write same code again and again instead writing same code we have to just call that function.

two types:-
---------
1)inbuilt functions:- the functions which are already present in the python len(),max() .....

2)user defined function:-
user can create their own function also

syntax:-
---------------------

def function_name():
	block of code


function_name()

we can also pass the parameter inside a function also.

syntax:-
--------------------

def function_name(parameter1,parameter2..........):
	block of code

function_name()

function can return the data as result.

syntax:-
----------------
def function_name(paramter1,paramter2):
	block of code

function_name()


class and objects:-
-----------------------

class is group of attributes and methods

what is attributes?
-------------
it is represented by variable.
a=40
seq="ATCTGC"

what is methods?
-----------
method which perform action or task.it is similar to function.

object:-
--------
object is collection of data and methods which act on those data.


class-> sketch of house
it contains all information about doors windowns,..etc
using info. we can build the house 
that house is called object


syntax:-
--------

class class_name:
	
	attributes


in class and objects there are some reserved methods and reserved keywords are present.

__init__():- this is reserved method in python	class.

this methods is getting called when we create the object of that class.
this method is used to initialise the attributes of the classes.

self:-

---------
self keyword is used to access the data .

object_name=class_name()


modules:-
---------
modules are allows you to logically organize your python code.

it is file containing python defination and python statements.

import keyword is used to import any module
